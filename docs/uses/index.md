This is my [uses page](https://uses.tech/), a list of hardware, software, and tools I use on a regular. 
I'm indecisive and change what I use often, so this may also change frequently.

## General Hardware

- [Apple Magic Keyboard with NumPad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXK73LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-and-numeric-keypad-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-usb-c-us-english-white-keys) - Work keyboard, I've found Mac hardware plays nicest with Macs. Not my favorite, but not terrible. Numpad is a must have. 
- [Apple Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXK93AM/A/magic-trackpad-usb%E2%80%91c-white-multi-touch-surface) - Thought I'd try this instead of a mouse when I joined Temporal. I like it better in some regards, less in others. Right click is harder. Long drags across multiple large monitors is harder. The gestures are easier and nice(1).

    1. **AND I CAN USE IT WHILE CHARGING!!!**
    
- **3 Monitors** - 2 Dells and an LG. I don't know the specs. They're all 27 inches or larger. I didn't buy them. I collect monitors as I traverse remote jobs. No one ever wants them back. They're my little trophies. But 3 is a must for full productivity. One for the IDE, one for my terminal to test, one for a browser for research(1).

    1. And for those of you who don't full screen your apps on a Mac, you terrify me. 
- [Das Keyboard Model 4 Ultimate](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-ultimate/) - Clicky blue switches all the way! And yes, the keycaps are blank.

## Development Tools

I write code daily in many languages, usually Python and Java, but also Go, TypeScript, lately Ruby, and the occasional C#. 
These are the tools I use on the daily. 

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Tried and true. Only IDE I use. Having to switch between coding and writing (done in Markdown), I use this for everything.
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) - AI-powered code editor, mostly used for vibe coding one off scripts. Not having the best luck with it for long running projects.
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) - MacOS Terminal Replacement.
- [Byobu](https://www.byobu.org/) - Open source text-based window manager for my terminal. 
- [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/)  and [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) - My go to AI tool(1). I use it daily. Coding, writing, ideas, stupid jokes, Claude does it all!

    1. I put this shit on everything.


## Productivity

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - Knowledge base and note-taking application, daily journal(1).

    1. When I remember to journal.... :grimace:

- [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/) - Keeping track of all my tasks across work, community, and home.
- [6ft Undated Reusable Whiteboard Calendar](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Dry-Erase-Wall-Calendar/dp/B07V3NY4K6) - This thing has been a game changer. I've had it for 3 years now, and I love it. I often tell people on meetings about it. "I'm not looking away, I'm checking my year calendar." For someone who travels for work a lot, a year at a glance has saved me so many potential double bookings. I also enjoy taking a picture of it at the end of every year and saving it. I can see all the work I did before I wipe it clean and start again.
- [Desktop Whiteboard Computer Buddy](https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Desktop-Computer-Pad-Whiteboard/dp/B09PC37B5Y) - Another amazing tool. Great for quick notes in a meeting, doubles as a phone stand and little drawer. I get this as Christmas presents for people now.
- [A _REAL_ Whiteboard](https://www.amazon.com/Dry-Erase-Whiteboard-Easel-Wheels/dp/B08CMXBTWQ) - Can you tell I like whiteboards? I've had cheap ones you can get online or from local stores, but I finally decided to get a good one(1). Totally worth it.

    1. Translation: I had home office budget to use.
