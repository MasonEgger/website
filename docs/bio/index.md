# Professional Biography / `tl;dr`
_I'm terrible at having to write bios for talks that I want to present, so I'm
putting it here just to keep everything together. If you need a bio for me, 
please take this one_.

> "On my business card, I am a Developer Advocate. In my mind, I am a programmer. But in my heart, I am a teacher." - paraphrased, original quote from Satoru Iwata
