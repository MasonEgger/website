Here's all the other things I do and like in no particular order

##Links

Here is a list of articles, books, videos, and other resources that I've read that have
helped me throughout my career. I'm constantly sharing these with people and 
forgetting where the link is so I'm making this page to alleviate unnecessary 
Googling and Slack Message searchs. 

If you find it useful too then that's alright too. lol :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

## Teaching

I've always had a passion for teaching. I feel this comes from being raised
in an educational environment. My mother, grandmother and grandfather, and 
great-grandfather were all teachers. My family lineage can be traced back the 
pioneers of education in Texas. I like to think that education is in my blood.
