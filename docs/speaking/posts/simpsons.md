# SLI's, SLA's and SL'D'OHS! Learning about Service Uptime from Homer Simpsons

Measuring service uptime can be a daunting task, but not for the 
Simpsons! Viewers will leave with a clearer understanding of how to account for 
services, how SLxs can define and guide what to monitor, and how to implement 
reliability targets and error budgets; all told by fabled Springfield wisdom

## Introduction

Building services is important, but what happens after they are built and 
running in production? How do we establish trust with our customers that our 
service will actually be available? Who creates these definitions and how do we 
measure them?
 
Service Level Indicators (SLI), Agreements (SLA), and Objectives (SLO) are 
central to an operations mindset and foundational tools for effective Site 
Reliability Engineering. This talk will take you on a journey through 
Springfield as we discuss exactly what SLIs, SLAs, and SLOs are, how to measure 
them, what targets should be measured, how to define uptime, availability, and 
acceptable error rates, and what happens when they are breached.
