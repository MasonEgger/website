# Python 102: Beyond the Basics

In this Workshop, you will go beyond the basics of Python and explore various language features that make Python _pythonic_. 


<!-- more -->

One of the benefits to Python is the ability to be productive while knowing a 
small subset of the features the language has to offer. While this is one of Python's
super powers, many Python developers are missing out on the full experience by not
diving deeper into the wonderful features Python has to offer. 

In this tutorial, you will go beyond the basics of Python and explore various language
features that make Python _pythonic_. Specifically, you will learn about:

1. Fist-class Functions
1. Decorators
1. Comprehensions
1. Dunder Methods & Operator Overloading
1. Context Managers

This will be a hands on tutorial. All exercises will be distributed as a GitHub
repository and as Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab.
