# There's a Snake in the Birdhouse! Building a Python Culture at Vrbo

We all love Python, but not everyone is fortunate enough to use it
at their day job. Come and listen as I detail the journey I took to establish 
Python as an onroad option at my company. Viewers will leave having learned 
from my experiences—both successes and mistakes—and with a solid plan for 
implementing Python at their job.

## Introduction

It’s no surprise why many of us are so enamored with Python. Its simplicity, 
accessibility, and community make it a prime choice for many projects. However, 
not all software engineering shops use Python, maybe even some of the jobs you 
work at. Introducing Python to your company and building a Pythonic culture from 
the ground up is no small task, but it can be done. Join me as I take you 
through the journey of getting Python from zero to hero within my company. I’ll 
share the experience from start to finish, including what worked, what didn’t, 
what I would have done differently, and how I evangelized Python to bring it to 
be a supported language within my company’s ecosystem.
