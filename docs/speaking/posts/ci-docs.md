# Building Docs like Code: Continuous Integration for Documentation
This talk discusses why developers dislike writing documentation,
what we can do to address this, and provides a ready to go pipeline for 
automating your documtation

<!-- more -->

Project documentation is easy to neglect. Keep your docs inside your source
repo & learn how to automatically build & publish beautiful docs on every
commit. Viewers will leave with a new mindset on how to handle documentation,
tooling for this process, & an easy-to-implement method to achieve this.

**Note, I typically tweak my slides a bit before each talk. These slides may
not be the _exact_ talk you saw, but they are pretty close.**

*This talk has been officially retired. I may revist the concepts in a few years,
but I think 5 presentations is enough for now.*
