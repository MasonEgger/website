For years a heated debate has been waged over a simple question: "Is Software Engineering a _real_ Engineering vocation?"
People on both sides adamantly defend their point of view.
Regardless of what side you're on, the advent of LLMs and code generation has made one thing clear.
Software Engineering is no longer about writing code. 
And let's be honest, it never truly was.

## A Gem at an Estate Sale

A new hobby that I've picked up is on the weekends my husband and I like to frequent estate sales.
For some reason I feel I don't have enough shit in my house, so I've taken the liberty of filling it with other people's shit.
This leads to finding all sorts of _wild_ gems.
Do I now have a painting of a hallucinogenic view of Austin, TX from the vantage point looking across Lady Bird Lake?
You bet your ass.
But every now and then you come across some fun stuff.
One of my favorite things is to look at antique books, especially school books(1).
Recently I came across a book of logarithms. 
Not a book teaching logarithms, a book with a table of logarithms that you could look up the answer to a specific logarithm given certain parameters.

1. These make me realize just how much we've dumbed down the education system, because I couldn't do the math those kids were doing in 8th grade when I was a senior, but that's a topic for another day.

This fascinated me. (1)
I'd never seen anything like this.
It never occurred to me that someone would calculate the logarithm _for an absurdly large amount of numbers_ and then publish it as reference material.
In hindsight it makes sense, but digital calculators were commonplace by the time I was born.

1. And I'm still kicking myself for not buying it.

Regardless of how I felt flipping through the pages of this curious antique on a random Saturday afternoon, it got me thinking.
At some time, _this_ was useful. 
There were people who's professions depended on this book.
There are likely countless structures, such as roads, bridges, dams, that a book like this was consulted when designing it.
People in this profession may have even memorized common logarithms that they worked with on a regular basis.
Or they learned how to calculate them in their head quickly. 
Maybe they even prided themselves on this ability.
They were faster than others because they didn't have to go flip through pages in a book every time they needed a calculation. 
And then, perhaps seemingly overnight, a device became available that could fit in your pocket that could do all of this for you.

The HP-35, named for its 35 keys (1), made this book obsolete.
While the price tag may have dissuaded people initially, eventually they became cheap enough than anyone could afford one.
And then we put a calculator in the pocket of every person on the planet via their phone(2).
Being able to calculate the logarithms in your head became a parlor trick, and eventually not even taught in school(3).
With this step forward in technology, a skill set that some held, and maybe even prided themselves in, became obsolete.
It was no longer needed.
And this probably scared the shit out of people.
They had been doing something their entire life, they were valued for the speed and precision that they brought, and then suddenly the aspect that gave them a sense of pride was vanquished by a machine.

1. We just don't market like they did in the 70s. "Well Bob what should we call it?" "I don't know Frank, how many keys does it have?" It was a golden age. 
2. Anyone else have a math teacher in school tell them "You won't have a calculator in your pocket everywhere you go!" Jokes on you, we do. 
3. I sure as shit don't know how to _manually_ calculate one.

This may be a tad hyperbolic, because let's be real.
There were probably few people whose sole job was calculating logarithms. 
But let's look at another example that isn't.

## Dorothy Vaughan and the IBM

If you haven't seen the movie or read the book [Hidden Figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures) yet, I highly recommend it.
It tells the story of the Black women "Computers" whose job it was to do the calculations for NASA during the Space Race (late 1950s - 1960s).
This was before computers as we know them(1) came to be.
The term "Computers" here was actually a job that someone did, where they would perform the advanced mathematical operations of various engineering fields by hand(2).
Because that's what they did.
They computed things.
They may have had specialized mechanical calculators, and some computers were available in the world, but not at the scale you may be thinking.
At this time computers were the size of a room, and had less power than a TI-84 calculator.
So these calculations had to be computed by hand.
And I bet you that they used a logarithm reference like the one mentioned above.

1. You know, that thing you're reading this blog on.
2. I'm about to overload the shit out of this term and I can't think of a better way to do it. Big C Computer means the human Computer, little c computer means the thing you think means computer. Good luck.

## Genesis

When I was in college getting my undergraduate degree at Texas State University, I worked as an undergraduate instructional assistant for the Department of Computer Science.
My job was to monitor the labs, tutor students on their homework, and eventually teach the instructional labs that went along with the introductory computer science courses. 
In the first class, I would ask the my students "What do you study when you are studying Computer Science?"
And often they would reply with programming.
Some would say hardware, others would get closer and say logic. 
I would then explain that it's a combination of all of that, but in reality, it's more the study of logic, algorithms, and information theory (1).

1. I would usually water it down a bit, no need to needlessly scare the freshman. That's what we have Discrete Math II for. 

Then I would recite one of my favorite quotes of all time:

> Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. - Edsger W. Dijkstra

This always seemed to make them think, and then we'd move on with the lesson.
