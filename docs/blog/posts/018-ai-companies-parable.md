### The Company that Drinks Too Much from the Well of AI Bullshit



### The Company that Shuns AI

Here is the story of the company that chooses to shun AI, either by slow rolling its adoption or banning it all together.
This company will be viewed as courageous by some, stupid by others. 
It will embrace this as part of its identity and own it.
This will attract individuals to apply at the company, either those who don't want to learn AI or can't find success using AI.
Now, some very fine people will go to work at this company, but this posture will also bring trouble.
For it will attract the "brilliant assholes".

These are the folks who can write 20x the code as their colleagues, but no one can stand to work with or be around.
They don't contribute to strategy, they are offensive and have HR complaints, they don't mentor new employees, but their output has defined their career and it's high enough that they are tolerated.
In an AI driven org, where everyone is outputting as much as they are, their behavior is no longer tolerated, and they are shown the door.
So the only place of refuge they will have will be places like this company, which proudly shuns AI.
There will be a high concentration of these "brilliant assholes" here, which will make working at this company a living hell for many of the employees.
This will lead to a high turnover rate and a decrease in efficiency.

Now, 
A competitor who didn't shun AI and hopefully used their functioning brain will enter the space, and slowly eat away at their market share. 
Eventually the company will be forced to decide to either adopt AI to catch up, or they'll continue on their course to their eventual demise. 

### The Company that Uses Their Functioning Brain
What used to take a team of ten engineers six months now may take a team of four ai-assisted engineers six weeks(1).
