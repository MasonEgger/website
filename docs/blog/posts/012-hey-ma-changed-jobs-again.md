Oh look, I've changed careers again.
I am no longer in Developer Relations, but am now a Solutions Architect on the sales team for a month now.
I'm sure many of you have questions, so let me take you on the journey of how I came to this decision.

<!-- more -->

## What's Changed

On 9/1/2025 I was officially transferred from the Developer Relations team in Marketing to the Solutions Architecture team in Sales.
I'm posting this a month out after having given myself time to adjust to the change, and I had PTO(1).
I have not left Temporal, nor do I want to.
Temporal is an _amazing_ company to work for.
It's easily in the top 2 jobs I've had and it's closing in on best job.
It's also the job I've been at the longest(2).
There were a lot of reasons why I made this change, so let's just jump into them.

1. Disney World!!!!
2. So long as you don't count my time working at Texas State University, which doesn't really count because I worked there while I was a student, and being a Lab Instructor with an on-campus office while doing my undergrad was absolutely fantastic.

## What This Move Isn't

Many people will make assumptions on why I made this move.
Even if I start with the postives, people will "read between the lines" and try to infer something that isn't there(1).
So I'm gonna lead with what this move _wasn't_ in the hope to head that off(2).
To be clear, this move was in no way inspired by negative interactions, presumed industry trends, or made in haste.

1. Kinda like when your English teacher tried to tell you that the color of the drapes in the house symbolized something. Blue for rebirth. Maybe the drapes were just fucking blue.
2. But alas, some of you will make your own stories to fit some narrative. That's fine. If you do, can you _please_ include warlocks that fly on enchanted unicorn manatees that breath fire? If you're gonna make shit up, at least make it entertaining. 

### No, Temporal Management Isn't Terrible

Quite the contrary honestly, Temporal Management has been extremely supportive and encouraging through this process.
Both my manager and the director of DevRel were sad to see me depart, but excited for me to advance my career.
They supported me through the entire process, helped me offboard effectively, and handled the entire situation with professionalism.
Pair that with the enthusiasm of my new manager, and this process has been unbelievably smooth.

Y'all know me, if management is bad, I bounce(1).
Not here.
Are things perfect?
Hell no.
If they were I'd probably run like hell.
Show me a place that has no issues whatsoever and I'll show you a place hiding some **dark** shit.
But the issues here were so minor, I often laughed at them.
"Do we use story points or time estimates?"
"This deadline slipped because the content was more complex than I thought and it took me a little longer to write it."
"We have too much to do and not enough time to do it(2)."
{ .annotate }

1. Ain't nobody got time for that.
2. Again, show me somewhere where this _isn't_ true, and I'll show you a place that's gearing up for layoffs, **especially** in the current market. 

At the end of it all, leadership at Temporal is superb.
So much so they actually made me feel safe in taking this sudden exit off the highway crossing 3 lanes of traffic(1). 
And for that, I'm grateful and I look forward to continuing my time at Temporal.

1. Don't worry, I used my blinker. I'm not **that** stupid.

### No, DevRel isn't dead

I'm so tired of this talking point.
It feels like click bait already.
Is DevRel going through a transition period?
Absolutely.
But to make foolish claims that DevRel is somehow dead or dying is just fucking stupid and shows a complete misunderstanding of the role of DevRel(1).
{ .annotate }

1. I have _soooo_ much to say on this topic, so yeeting this into the blog posts for the future pile. 

Without going into a dissertation style rant, here's the reality of what's happening.

**DevRel is evolving.**

How developers learn and program is changing daily. 
We're already seeing this take place in real time.
Google's share of search engine traffic is down for the first time [in decades](https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2025/04/14/the-60-problem---how-ai-search-is-draining-your-traffic/).
Stack overflow traffic is [falling off a cliff](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/stack-overflow-is-almost-dead/).
Non-fiction book sales are [declining](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/financial-reporting/article/98147-print-book-sales-slipped-in-first-half-of-2025.html).
The list goes on and on.
So what's happing. 
I'll give you a hint.
It's an acronym that's two vowels next to each other.

So how does this affect DevRel?
Well, many DevRel functions focus primarily on written content. 
Why do they do this? 
Because it's the easiest to measure. 
DevRel _knows_ written content works, because some poorly configured dashboard said it does. (1)
This means a _lot_ of DevRel teams are reevaluating what they can do to have an impact.
This isn't a **bad** thing.
_This is how functions **should** work._
Challenge your assumptions.
Try something bold.
Break outside the box.
So when I hear that AI killed DevRel, or Docs, or anything, I scoff.
DevRel is going through an exciting recalibration phase, and I look forward to what this holds. (2)

1. I get better results from `/dev/urandom` than I do from Google Analytics.
2. "Well then why did you leave if you're excited?" I hear you all saying. First, I'm getting to that, keep reading. Two, you can be excited for something and not participate in it. I'm excited for space travel, but you aren't strapping my ass to a rocket.

### No, This was Not a Sudden Decision

Contrary to outward appearances, I do take time to make these kind of decisions.
While my departures or changes can seem like they came out of left field, I typically contemplate them for _months_ before making the change.
What tends to confuse people is once my mind is made up, I'm confident in it and there's no going back. 
So outwardly, it looks sudden.
But in reality, I have been thinking about this decision for almost a year.

## What This Move Is

Growth opportunity.


### A Way to Expand My Knowledge

I'll be frank, I don't plan on working at Temporal for the rest of my career(1).
The era of staying at a job for 40+ years went out the door two generations ago.
My dad is about to retire from his job after 43 years as the same job, in the same role(2).
That's not how tech works.
We're _expected_ to move on after a short amount of time.
Now I don't currently have any plans to leave Temporal.
I mean it when I say I'm legit happy and proud to work here.
But am I still here a decade from now? 
Highly unlikely.
But will I still be _using_ Temporal a decade from now?
No doubt in my mind.
This is by far the most amazing tech I've ever worked with, and has a permanent place in my stack. 
Because of this, I found

1. And let's be real, no one expects me to.
2. That's the luxury of a union job with amazing benefits and a pension. Something we sure as shit don't have in tech.
