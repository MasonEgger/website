Oh look, I've changed careers again.
I am no longer in Developer Relations, but am now a Solutions Architect on the sales team.
I'm sure many of you have questions, so let me take you on the journey of how I came to this decision.

## What's Changed

On 9/1/2025 I was officially transferred from the Developer Relations team in Marketing to the Solutions Architecture team in Sales.
I have not left Temporal, nor do I want to.
Temporal is an _amazing_ company to work for.
It's easily in the top 2 jobs I've had and it's closing in on best job.
It's also the job I've been at the longest(1).
There were a lot of reasons why I made this change, so let's just jump into them.

1. So long as you don't count my time working at Texas State University, which doesn't really count because I worked there while I was a student, and being a Lab Instructor with an on-campus office while doing my undergrad was absolutely fantastic.

## What This Move Isn't

This move was in no way inspired by negative interactions, presumed industry trends, or made in haste.

### No, Temporal Management Isn't Terrible

Quite the contrary honestly, Temporal Management has been extremely supportive and encouraging through this process.
Both my manager and the director of DevRel were sad to see me depart, but excited for me to advance my career.
They supported me through the entire process, helped me offboard effectively, and handled the entire situation with professionalism.
Pair that with the enthusiasm of my new manager, and this process has been unbelievably smooth.

Y'all know me, if management is bad, I bounce(1).
Not here.
Are things perfect?
Hell no.
If they were I'd probably run like hell.
Show me a place that has no issues whatsoever and I'll show you a place hiding some **dark** shit.
But the issues here were so minor, I often laughed at them.
"Do we use story points or time estimates?"
"This deadline slipped because the content was more complex than I thought and it took me a little longer to write it."
"We have too much to do and not enough time to do it(2)."

1. Ain't nobody got time for that.
2. Again, show me somewhere where this _isn't_ true, and I'll show you a place that's gearing up for layoffs, **especially** in the current market. 

At the end of it all, leadership at Temporal is superb.
So much so they actually made me feel safe in taking this sudden exit off the highway crossing 3 lanes of traffic(1). 
And for that, I'm grateful and I look forward to continuing my time at Temporal.

1. Don't worry, I used my blinker. I'm not **that** stupid.

### No, DevRel isn't dead

I'm so tired of this talking point.
It feels like click bait already.
Is DevRel going through a transition period?
Absolutely.
But to make foolish claims that DevRel is somehow dead or dying is just fucking stupid and shows a complete misunderstanding of the role of DevRel(1).

1. I have _soooo_ much to say on this topic, so yeeting this into the blog posts for the future pile. 

Without going into a dissertation style rant, here's the highlights of my thoughts on this.

#### DevRel is evolving. 

How developers learn and program is changing daily. We're already seeing
