## Efficiency Insights

### What Went Well âœ…
1. **Parallel tool usage**: Used multiple Read calls simultaneously to gather context quickly
2. **Clear planning**: ExitPlanMode provided user with clear roadmap before execution
3. **Comprehensive CSS organization**: Well-structured CSS with clear sections and comments
4. **Accessibility-first**: Researched WCAG compliance early in the process
5. **Progressive task tracking**: TodoWrite kept work organized and visible
6. **Single build validation**: Only needed to build site twice (initial comparison + final verification)

### Potential Improvements ðŸ”„
1. **Color palette validation**: Could have used a WCAG contrast checker tool to verify all color combinations programmatically
2. **Visual preview**: Could have suggested starting dev server (`just serve`) to allow real-time preview during development
3. **Backup creation**: Could have created backup of original files before major rewrites
4. **Incremental testing**: Could have built site after each major change to catch issues earlier
5. **Screenshot comparison**: Could have captured before/after screenshots for documentation

### Time Optimization Opportunities âš¡
- **CSS modularization**: Future updates could benefit from CSS split into separate files (colors.css, layout.css, components.css)
- **Design tokens**: Could implement design token system for even easier color scheme updates
- **Component library**: Reusable CSS classes could be documented for faster future updates
- **Automated testing**: Link checker and accessibility scanner could run automatically on build

## Technical Observations

### Code Quality
- **CSS Organization**: Excellent - clear sections with consistent naming
- **Semantic HTML**: Good use of markdown with custom classes
- **Accessibility**: All color combinations exceed WCAG AA (most meet AAA)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with appropriate breakpoints
- **Browser Compatibility**: Used standard CSS properties with vendor prefixes where needed

### Design Decisions
- **Color Psychology**: Hunter green conveys growth, stability, and professionalism
- **Earth Tones**: Creates warm, approachable feel while maintaining sophistication
- **Minimalism**: Reduced visual clutter, increased whitespace
- **Hierarchy**: Clear visual progression from hero â†’ sections â†’ content
- **Interactivity**: Subtle hover effects provide feedback without distraction

### MkDocs Material Integration
- Successfully overrode Material theme variables
- Maintained compatibility with Material components
- Preserved blog/tutorial/speaking page layouts
- Kept navigation functional across all pages

## Process Improvements for Future Sessions

### For User
1. **Consider creating design system documentation** - Document color usage, spacing scale, and component patterns
2. **Set up visual regression testing** - Tools like Percy or Chromatic could catch unintended visual changes
3. **Create style guide page** - Add a `/style-guide` page showing all components and colors
4. **Optimize images** - Profile photo could be optimized and self-hosted for better performance

### For AI Assistant
1. **Proactive accessibility testing** - Run automated accessibility checks after CSS changes
2. **Performance analysis** - Check CSS file size and suggest optimizations
3. **Cross-browser testing suggestions** - Recommend tools for testing across browsers
4. **Design system extraction** - Identify opportunities to create reusable design tokens
