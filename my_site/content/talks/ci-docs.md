automating your documtation"

Project documentation is easy to neglect. Keep your docs inside your source
repo & learn how to automatically build & publish beautiful docs on every
commit. Viewers will leave with a new mindset on how to handle documentation,
tooling for this process, & an easy-to-implement method to achieve this.
