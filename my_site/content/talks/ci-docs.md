description: "My talk at PyTexas 2019 and Texas Linux Fest 2019 about the
documentation process and building CI/CD for your docs."
---

Project documentation is easy to neglect. Keep your docs inside your source
repo & learn how to automatically build & publish beautiful docs on every
commit. Viewers will leave with a new mindset on how to handle documentation,
tooling for this process, & an easy-to-implement method to achieve this.

This talk was given at [PyTexas 2019](https://www.pytexas.org/2019/) and will
be given at [Texas Linux Fest 2019](https://2019.texaslinuxfest.org/)
