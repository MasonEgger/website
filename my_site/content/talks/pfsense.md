*This is the talk I submitted at for Texas Linux Festival 2016 over pfSense.
Official conference description below*

Tired of your home router's UI? Wish you could have more control over
everything in your network? Looking to replace enterprise routers with
something OpenSource and easy to use? This session is a dive into the vast
world of pfSense and the features it provides. In a world where security is
becoming more complex, we need a simple, sensible tool to help keep us secure.

pfSense is an Open Source Firewall built on FreeBSD and their port of the
OpenBSD pf (packet filter) firewall. With a quick setup and an extremely well
designed web UI deploying industry firewalls has never been easier. I will go 
over a little bit of the history/design of pfSense, discuss some of the key
features, and demonstrate standing up a basic pfSense VM and routing other VM
traffic through it. (It's so easy I can do it in about 5-8 minutes).
