description: "After decades of trying to ignore or straight up bashing Linux, 
Microsoft has finally embraced the loveable penguin. So much so that it ships a
Linux kernel on your Windows OS by default! What does this mean for the sake of
development? Is it finally the year of the Linux desktop?"

## Year of the Linux Desktop
My first job was as a lab instructor/developer for the Computer Science 
department at Texas State University, starting in the summer of 2012. My boss was what I would call 
_The Linux Dude_. You know who I'm talking about. Socks with sandles, utility
clothing (pockets in pockets for pockets), and of course, a glorious beard
that would make Albus Dumbledore proud. He pretty much personified the 
_Unix Guy_ from the classic [Dilbert comic](https://dilbert.com/strip/1995-06-24).
Between him and a few select others I was constantly told about how this year 
would finally be the year Linux became popular on the desktop and how it would 
signal the end of Microsoft's dominance on the PC. I then decided to try Ubuntu
on my personal machine, and after about three months decided this was all wishful
thinking and promptly reinstalled Windows. But every time I went to a Linux 
meetup or conference the phrase "year of the Linux desktop" was always being 
uttered. Personally, like many, I thought it was never going to happen. However,
I think I can proudly say that 2019 is in fact, the year of the Linux desktop....
just not how anyone envisioned it.
