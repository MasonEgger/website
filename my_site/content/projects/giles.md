## Inspiration

Who better to inspire a simple, clever, and easy-to-use Integrated Library
System than one of the most badass librarians ever?

## The Project
This project aims to be a simple Integrated Library System for personal
libraries. Most of the open source ILS have tons of features that I don't
really need or want. The main goal of this was to make sure I don't purchase
a book twice whilst on a binge purchase at Barnes & Noble, to know who I've
lent books to, and let others view and search my library so they don't buy
me a gift book I already own. Most definitely more features will be added,
but I'm happy with that being a 1.0 release.

## Current Progress
The project stalled right out of the gate, but it is still something I 
desparately want to work on. It is just, unfortunately, further down the
priority list of projects. :disappointed:
