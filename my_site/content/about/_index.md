# Professional Biography / `tl;dr`
_I'm terrible at having to write bios for talks that I want to present, so I'm
putting it here just to keep everything together. If you need a bio for me, 
please take this one_.

Mason Egger is a Site Reliability Engineer at HomeAway, where he works on the
internal PaaS that hosts all of HomeAway's websites, data streaming, and
tooling. He is an avid programmer, musician, educator, and writer/blogger at
[masonegger.com](https://www.masonegger.com). In his spare time he enjoys
camping, kayaking, and exploring new places.


# Longer, More Robust Biography
I am currently a Senior Site Reliability Engineer for the Cloud Platform Team
at HomeAway (a member of Expedia Group) in Austin, Texas. My team and I build
and maintain a Platform as a Service for all HomeAway developers.
We are currently running tens of thousands of containers running on hundreds of
nodes in datacenters in multiple datacenters around the world. 

I have worked as both a software/systems engineer and systems administrator.
I am passionate about Python, Education, Security, Privacy, all things Open
Source (technologies, communities, oddly licenses...) just to name a few. I
currently volunteer teaching AP Computer Science A at a local high school in
Austin 3 times a week, as well as designing the intensive curriculum that we
use.

I'm a graduate of Texas State University, receiving dual degrees in Computer
Science (BS) and Music (BA). I'm currently a graduate student at Georgia Tech,
in the Online Masters of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program.
