I am currently a Senior Site Reliability Engineer for the Cloud Platform Team
at HomeAway (a member of Expedia Group) in Austin, Texas. My team and I build
and maintain a Platform as a Service for all HomeAway developers.
We are currently running tens of thousands of containers running on hundreds of
nodes in datacenters in multiple datacenters around the world. 

I have worked as both a software/systems engineer and systems administrator.
I am passionate about Python, Education, Security, Privacy, all things Open
Source (technologies, communities, oddly licenses...) just to name a few. I
currently volunteer teaching AP Computer Science A at a local high school in
Austin 3 times a week, as well as designing the intensive curriculum that we
use.

I'm a graduate of Texas State University, receiving dual degrees in Computer
Science (BS) and Music (BA). I'm currently a graduate student at Georgia Tech,
in the Online Masters of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program.
