what we can do to address this, and provides a ready to go pipeline for 
automating your documtation"

Project documentation is easy to neglect. Keep your docs inside your source
repo & learn how to automatically build & publish beautiful docs on every
commit. Viewers will leave with a new mindset on how to handle documentation,
tooling for this process, & an easy-to-implement method to achieve this.

not be the _exact_ talk you saw, but they are pretty close.**
