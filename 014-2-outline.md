# OUTLINE - Code is Cheap (Knowing What to Write Isn't)

**Core Thesis:** The value of software engineering was never the code—it's knowing what code to write. AI without your guidance is worthless; AI with your engineering judgment is a superpower.

## Structure

### 1. Opening: The Consultant Joke (NEW - make this the hook)
> "How much to fix this?"
> "$500."
> "For pushing one button?!"
> "$5 to push the button. $495 to know which button to push."

- This has always been true for software engineering
- We just convinced ourselves (and our employers) that the button-pushing was the hard part
- AI has made the truth undeniable: **code is cheap**

### 2. Code is Cheap (Restructured from original)
- AI is a faster programmer than you
- It knows more languages, algorithms, and patterns than you
- It has more energy than you
- **"Who gives a shit?"**
- Are you jealous of your car because it can carry more weight?
- "The value of software engineering is not the code, it's the product."

### 3. But What About Hallucinations? (PROMOTED FROM FOOTNOTE)
**This needs to be a main section, not buried.**

- Yes, AI hallucinates. It will lie to you convincingly.
- But here's the thing: your guardrails should catch this
- Tests, linters, type checkers—these exist for a reason
- AI works best WITH guardrails, and can even run them for you

**THE KEY LINE (make this prominent, not a footnote):**
> "If you're uncomfortable right now, that's on you, not the AI. Get your shit together."

- Do YOU write perfect code the first time? No.
- You're still responsible for what goes to production—whether you wrote it, the intern wrote it, or AI wrote it.

### 4. The Math is Obvious
- Day to write 10,000 lines vs. 45 seconds + an hour to review
- The reward far outweighs the risk
- Why are people terrified? Because they valued implementation over design.
- "Code is cheaper than it ever has been, and the most expensive it ever will be again."

### 5. The Engineering Debate—Resolved (Keep, this is strong)
- For years: "Is software engineering REAL engineering?"
- The craft layer is being abstracted away (just like CAD/CNC for mechanical engineers)
- When code generation is abundant, constraints become the focus
- This may be the end of (human-created) technical debt
- Verification becomes paramount—this IS traditional engineering
- The theory is no longer optional: algorithms, CAP theorem, consensus protocols matter

### 6. Proof It's Already Happening: The Ghostty Example (Keep)
- Mitchell Hashimoto's tweet about someone fixing Ghostty bugs
- Zero experience with Zig, macOS, or terminal internals
- Knew how to drive AI + had an engineering mindset
- Fixed 4 real crashing cases
- "This is the sign of a mature engineering discipline."

### 7. A Fork in the Road (Tighten)
- You have the same choice Dorothy Vaughan had
- Rise to the challenge or cling to the past
- Predictions (keep but acknowledge they're aggressive):
  - 2 years: majority of code written by AI
  - 5 years: all of it
  - 10 years: handwriting code = calculating derivatives by hand in school
- Even Linus Torvalds admitted AI wrote better code than he could for a noise reduction tool

### 8. The Path Forward (Keep, this is the landing)
- This shift isn't easy—skills you mastered are being devalued in real time
- But you don't have time to panic
- Take a breath. This is a marathon, not a sprint.
- Everyone who looks like an AI wizard started where you are now
- Pick up a tool. Make your life better with it. Then pick up another.

**BUT (the turn):**
- You DO have to start. This isn't optional anymore.
- The "wait and see" window is over.
- There's still time to catch up, but every day you wait, someone pulls ahead.

### 9. Closing
- "I started using Claude Code six months ago, and it has dramatically changed my life."
- Link to the Claude Code blog (coming soon)
- "The future belongs to those who show up for it."

## Key Changes from Original

1. **Open with the consultant joke** - this crystallizes the entire thesis
2. **Promote the QA/tests point from footnote to main section** - it's too powerful to bury
3. **"Get your shit together"** should hit hard, not be parenthetical
4. **The Ghostty example is perfect proof** - keep it prominent
5. **Tighten "A Fork in the Road"** - the predictions are good but the section meanders

## Tone Notes
- This post should feel more urgent and direct than Part 1
- Part 1 is "here's why this is happening" (historical, explanatory)
- Part 2 is "here's what you need to do about it" (practical, challenging)
- The humor can stay but the stakes should feel real
