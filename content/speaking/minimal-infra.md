## Introduction

Cloud infrastructure can be complex, making figuring out which products and services – often from a list of unfamiliar terms – a daunting task. Join Developer Advocate Mason Egger as he walks you through how to build a minimal, production-ready architecture that pieces together many of DigitalOcean's products. We'll use Terraform to build a production-ready infrastructure for your project or business in real time. Follow along or spin up your own. The code is hosted on GitHub [here](https://do.co/tf-sample-archs).
