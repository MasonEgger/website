## Introduction

Think of that feeling you get when you follow an online tutorial or documentation and the code works on the first run. Now think of all the hours spent wasted following broken, outdated, or incomplete documentation. From our favorite tutorials to bad product docs we all consume technical writing. Tutorials, blog posts, and product docs help developers learn new things, build projects, and debug issues. But what makes one tutorial better than another? In this talk I'll discuss how you can write the documentation that developers love and Iâ€™ll share 10 tips and tricks to improve your technical writing.
