## About the Talk
Keeping your users’ data safe is important in the digital age. People’s entire lives are now online in some way. One of the first things you can do to ensure your users’ safety is to ensure their data is transmitted to you and back securely, and for that, we use SSL. SSL is the tool responsible for HTTPS and the little safe green lock in your browser telling your user that any data they transmit to your site will be done securely.

### What You'll Learn
* What SSL is, its history, how it works, and why we need it
* Securing your sites with Certbot
* Modern web servers with SSL on by default (Caddy)

### This Talk is Designed For
Systems administrators, DevOps engineers, first-time web developers, students.

### Prerequisites
* Knowledge of how to install packages on a Linux operating system and deploy a website to a server using Nginx, Apache, or Caddy. Ubuntu is used in this talk.
