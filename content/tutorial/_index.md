These are technical tutorials on various topics that interest me or problems
I have solved. 

These tutorials are in a similar style to the tutorials you'd
find at [DigitalOcean](https://do.co/tutorials), as that is where my primary 
technical writing education occurred. 

I routinely update and test these tutorials,
so pay attention to messaging at the top of each that details the last time the 
tutorial was updated.

If you find an error in a tutorial or want to request a tutorial, please open an issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/MasonEgger/website/issues)


I hope these help you out! If they do and you want to give me a shoutout, feel
free to [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/masonegger)
