Here is a list of articles, books, and other resources that I've read that have
helped me throughout my career. I'm constantly sharing these with people and 
forgetting where the link is so I'm making this page to alleviate unnecessary 
Googling and Slack Message searchs. 

If you find it useful too then that's alright too. lol :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
