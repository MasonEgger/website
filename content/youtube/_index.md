In July of 2016 I decided to start a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/masonegger) on all things BSD. I 
enjoyed making this content immensely, but after nearly a year of producing a
few videos a month I became burned out and decided to take a month break. Well,
a month turned into two and eventually, turned into nearly two years.
:grimacing: On January 1, 2019 I decided to repurpose the channel to a more
general channel about technology and anything I fancy.

I will post video releases here, along with links, code, transcripts, and other
relevant materials.
