description: "A common sentiment that comes up every so often in Tech spaces is \"You should/shouldn't work nights and weekends!\" and people have some very strong opinions about it. Let me tell you what happens when you work night and day, ignoring signs of burnout until it's too late."
---

Every month or so, I'll see a statement in a group or on Tech Twitter about 
whether an individual, new or experienced in the Tech field, should dedicate 
all of their spare time working as much as possible for their 
job because "that's how you'll get promoted." Or you see people with the opposite
opinion, that doing work or work-related things outside after hours as a harmful
thing to do (even if they themselves did it in their career at some point).

So which is it? 

## tl;dr

```
Determine what you want out of your career and how much you want to put into it.
Practice makes perfect, and companies won't always pay you to learn on their 
time. 

Then, take the necessary actions to achieve your goals. 
However, you must acceptthat everything comes with a tradeoff.

The unpleasant truth is that practice
will make you better. However, there are tradeoffs for every decision, 
and burnout can and will do more harm than any amount of extra work.
```

Now, you want to know my story and how I came to that conclusion, keep reading.

## Every Story Has A Beginning

There are a few good ol' timey sayings that may describe how I chose to approach
the beginning of my career.

* Burning the midnight oil
* Burning the candle at both ends
* Keep your nose to the grindstone
* Working your fingers to the bone

However, none of these accurately depict the level of obsessiveness that I developed
with coding and learning. I think a more accurate phrase here would be dumping
the midnight oil on the grindstone and candle and setting the whole damn thing
on fire. And I managed to pull this off for almost five years before I woke up
one day and had had enough.

## My Story

### My Educational Experience
I started programming in High School. I took AP Computer Science A as a sophomore
and had mixed feelings towards it. Before this moment I had had very little 
experience with computers. My family had just gotten internet at my house[^1]. I 
decided to take AP Computer Science not because I was interested in the topic,
but because I wanted to be in my high school's Top 10[^2], and AP CS A was 
considered an advanced course, which would add more weight to my GPA. While I found
the subject material interesting, I wasn't enthralled by it[^3]. At the beginning
of the year, my teacher told us that she was the sponsor for the UIL[^4] Computer 
Science Team. While it wasn't a requirement of the class that students join
a team and compete, those who did often scored better on the AP exam due
to all the extra practice they would do as a result of competitions. I had done
UIL mathematics in elementary school and missed it, so I decided to sign up. 
Throughout the next three years, I would go from practicing an hour
after school, twice a week to arriving at school an hour early every day, staying
an hour late, taking multiple independent study courses with this teacher, and
blowing off some of my other classes to study and write code. And then, just like
end of any cheesy Hollywood movie, my team won the State competition my Senior
year of high school with me scoring second individually behind my best friend[^5].

And while this was truly magical and an experience I will cherish in my heart 
forever, there is a bit of darkness here. This experience validated my obsession.
It put the notion in my head that if I just obsess enough, I could accomplish 
anything. This confidence level is a _great_ thing to have until it doesn't
work anymore and you harm yourself.

After I graduated high school, I went off to Texas State University, not even 
intending on majoring in Computer Science. I was in band during high school and
had decided I wanted to be a band director. After a semester of not doing anything
programming-related, I realized that I missed programming and decided to change
majors to Computer Science[^6]. After only one semester as a CS student, I 
managed to get a job as a student worker in the Computer Science department at 
my University. I was initially hired to monitor open access labs and teach
introductory Computer Science labs for both majors and non-majors[^7]. However,
after a semester or two, I was selected to start working on more programming and
lab management projects (web development, OS installs, NetBoot). Because of this,
I was paired with brilliant individuals who worked on many different
projects and I wanted to learn it all. I would schedule all of my classes in the
morning and then work from the afternoon until the late evening (and very 
commonly into the following day). Those years in college I was averaging 4ish 
hours of sleep because I was constantly working and learning. I would stay in 
town during winter and summer breaks because it meant I could work _more_ hours
and get paid more. It was a fantastic time in my life, but I definitely developed
some bad habits during that time. Putting work and learning above all else being
one of them. It got so bad that my final summer working at the University
I traveled abroad for a month to finish up some schooling and could not work.
At that time I realized that I had worked at _least_ 25 hours a week[^8] every
single week for 108 weeks straight[^9].

### My Early Work Experience (Texas State & Forcepoint)

At the end of my Senior year in college it was time to start the job hunt. I
had returned from my month off studying abroad and immediately jumped back into
working long hours, if not longer. One of the perks of working at the University
was that I was given an office on campus. I would stay there all hours of the 
night working. After a few months of interviews, I accepted a position at 
Websense, which would change its name to Forcepoint a month after 
I joined. This company was owned by Raytheon, and I was going to be doing Cyber
Security work. I was ecstatic about this. Throughout my time at University I
had done a few Cyber Security competitions[^10] and taken some classes. I had decided
that was the direction I wanted to take my career. I was hired on a team that
had recently been created and was tasked with completely rewriting a 15-year-old
codebase in less than a year[^11]. This was a herculean task, but we were able to
pull it off with many extra hours worked. I definitely worked some nights and
weekends to get this project done, and to this day, it is one of the things I'm
most proud of in my career. But my coding obsession didn't stop there. On the 
days where I didn't work late, I would go home and continue coding. I started
a YouTube channel about the BSD Operating Systems. I was a big fan of the BSD
OSes but I hadn't really used them in production too much. I was still determined
to put out a video once a week, so I would spend my week learning, writing
the script, recording, editing, and uploading. It became a second job for me.

And then, quite suddenly, I started having trouble sleeping. I would toss and
turn for hours and get no sleep. This persisted for months. And my stupid ass,
not seeing the toll that all of this was having on me, got angry at myself
for being unable to sleep. So much so that when I couldn't sleep, I just decided
I might as well work on code or do something for my career[^12]. It got so bad
that I had to seek medical help, not only for the lack of sleep but because
at some times I legitimately thought I was losing my mind. After running some
tests, the doctors confirmed that it was simply massive amounts of stress. It was
odd; I never felt stressed by my work. I never got anxious or upset about it, but
it had become compulsive. I stepped back from my YouTube channel, started working
less outside of work, and took my PTO. Then one day, I'll never forget it,
I was recording a video for my YouTube channel after taking a few months
hiatus, and the code wasn't working. This wasn't uncommon, but for some reason,
this day, it bugged the shit out of me. I finally determined what was wrong, and
it was a problem with the old ass hardware I owned. I couldn't run FreeBSDs 
virtualization tool, Bhyve, on my clunky ass Dells. I tried everything I could,
 but I finally got frustrated enough and quit. I was done. At that time I had
an apartment with a home office in it. I didn't set foot in there for 3 months.

And it was oddly freeing.

## Realizing Your Burnt Out

A lot of people will have you believe that you wake up one morning, stretch, yawn,
get a cup of coffee, walk out on your back porch and say to yourself, "Chipper
morning. Oh, and I feel rather burnt out today"[^13]. It's a much more subtle change.
You find yourself zoning out at work. You start making mistakes on things that
you're working on that you usually wouldn't make. You find yourself more and more
disinterested in the work you're doing. Eventually, you fall into an autopilot-type
depression and find the days blending together. And then you commit what I consider
the cardinal sin of burnout. You decide that it's your current work environment
that is the issue and decide to leave.

Now let me be clear, it _very_ well could be that it is your work environment. 
That's what makes this so difficult. Because the symptoms of a bad work environment
and burnout are _unbelievably_ similar. The issue here is if you try to remedy
burnout the same way you would a toxic work situation, you risk the potential
of accelerating your burnout at a phenomenal rate. Let me tell you how I did 
_just that_.

### Leaving Forcepoint and Going to HomeAway/Vrbo

Around the year and a half mark at Forcepoint, after the rewrite, the company
decided to shift its focus to the Cloud. For those who weren't
around in the early 2010s[^14], this is where the "We're going to move our
business to the Cloud!" propaganda started. At the time, companies didn't really
know what the Cloud was, or if their giant ass monoliths could run in the Cloud [^15].
But companies were going there anyway! I was selected to work on this subteam
to envision what a redesign of our system would look like to be truly Cloud
Native. Now this was late 2017 - early 2018. Kubernetes was still young and I
believe that Istio was announced while I was at Kubecon in Austin in 2017. Spinnaker
sure was. There weren't any graduated projects in the CNCF by then so the landscape
was very undecided. While I should have been excited to be a part of this new team,
my tolerance for setbacks had become virtually non-existent. And instead of 
allowing my team to build prototypes and present our work, we had to form committees
and be in meetings. Everyone had opinions, and eventually progress ground to a
halt. 

Now at this point I felt that I had recovered from my YouTube channel burnout
and found myself back with my nose on the grindstone, except this time I was
learning about Cloud Native. But the reality is that I hadn't recovered. Burnout
recovery doesn't happen overnight. It doesn't happen in a month. Burnout isn't 
something that can be remedied with a week on the beach with alcohol. Burnout
can take _years_ to come back from, if you ever fully come back. I was 
experiencing a quiet moment where things didn't feel so overwhelming. These are
the moments you are supposed to use to help recover. What you absolutely should
not do is throw yourself back into the chasm you've been crawling out of. 

So the project continued. We would come up with ideas and prototypes just to
be killed by committee. No one knew what they actually wanted, so they just
said no to everything. So now we have a mixture of burnout with a frustrating 
work environment. This back and forth continued until it reached a boiling point.
And then, after a Thursday afternoon meeting, I walked out, threw my laptop on
my desk, and told my boss if I was back on Monday, it meant I still worked there.
At the time I lived less than a quarter of a mile from my job, so I walked to work
every day. On my way out of the building, I called a recruiter who had been emailing
me, and before I made it home, I had an interview lined up for the next day. Less
than a month later I started a new job at Homeaway/Vrbo. 

To this day, I don't know if I made the right choice[^16]. At the time I thought
I had just had enough of the bureaucracy and wanted out. But looking back at it
from a healthier place in my mental health, I don't think that was the only cause.
Other than dealing with roadblocks and bureaucracy[^17], I was happy at 
that job. I was working with a great friend; I loved my team, my manager was
terrific, as was my director. We made it through the fires of the rewrite, and
not a single person had left the team in over two years. So then why did I leave?
It's because I mistook the symptoms. What I attributed to as an unacceptable 
workplace was actually my burnout manifesting into magnifying even the slightest thing
into a huge issue. Burnout's a crafty devil. It isn't just "I don't want to do
this anymore." It sours everything. The phrase "One bad apple spoils the bunch"
is actually very apt here. And your reaction is to run. Run from this place 
because it's toxic. Run back to your safety net because you're comfortable there.
So I ran. I ran away from the job that used to make me happy into the unknown
because the grass is always greener, right?

Reality check. It isn't.

### The Vrbo Disaster

Things at Vrbo went south fast. Very fast. Like, second day on the job fast. At
this time, I wasn't really aware of my burnout. I had completely convinced myself
that the issues stemmed from my last job and would all disappear as
soon as I started at this new job. So, I walked into a backlog grooming session 
with my team excited and ready to get started. Throughout that hour
meeting, as we went over the tickets we had in the backlog, I came to the sinking
realization that I didn't want to work on a _single_ ticket. Nothing in our 
backlog of over 200 tickets had even the slightest appeal to me. It was at that 
moment that I came to the realization that I had burned out. And I'm not talking 
a little fizzle; I'm talking scorched earth burnt out. Barren wasteland level
of burnt out. And to make matters worse, I had traded a diverse team of amazing
people for a team of white dudes that epitomized the definition of "Brogrammers"
and toxic workplace culture. I was completely ignored by my team for the first
three months on the job. I had one 30 minute onboarding session and was
told to figure it out from there. I was largely excluded from meetings around
things that concerned my team. When I was invited, things were said that 
would have amounted to immediate dismissal at any other company. My manager would
skip 1:1s for months, and I was basically left to fend for myself[^18]. 

And at that point, I didn't care anymore. Burnout and Toxic Workplace go together
like water and a grease fire. 

## Living and Having to Work While Burnt Out

What is someone to do when they figure out, within the first few weeks of their
new job, that they hate it? Why blame themselves and try desperately to fix it!
I tried for months to come to terms with my new situation. I tried to make friends
with my new team, to no avail. It became obvious that my team didn't actually
want me there. They were forced to fill a role of another person similar to me
who, come to find out later, they also drove out of the role. 

Burnout is a lot like quicksand. The harder you struggle against it, the faster 
you sink. Nothing I did had any impact. Eventually, I gave up. I started working
from home so I could avoid my team and work. I would go into the office probably
three times a week for meetings. I barely got any work done because I was so
depressed. There would be days I would stare at my screen and barely type a
sentence. 

America, in particular our Capitalistic system, doesn't have any way of helping
burnt-out individuals. If you want your paycheck, you still have to come to
work. The only upside to my situation was that my team paid so little attention
to me that I did very little work at the time. It's not something
I'm proud of, but at that time, I was focused on keeping myself together, not
the profit margins of a Fortune 500 company. So I trudged on, day after day, 
week after week, hating my job and hating my life. The only upside to this entire
thing was that I was privy to some fascinating conversations about building
and managing large-scale cloud infrastructures [^19].

And so I sat, letting the world pass me by, desperately seeking a lifeboat to 
save me. And, by some miracle, I found one.

## Coming Back from Burnout

I learned a long time ago that I love conferences. I attended a few in college[^20]
and found that community was a calling of mine. While at Forcepoint, I took
a leap and traveled to Portland in 2017 for PyCon US. This was my first time 
leaving the state by myself in such a way, and I loved it. I continued to go to 
PyCon and attempted to submit papers to no avail. During one of these conferences
I found out about a regional Python conference called PyTexas held
in the city where I lived. I decided to write a talk about a topic that is very
dear to me[^21] and submit it to PyTexas. My talk got accepted, and I was ecstatic.
I began prepping and fine-tuning my talk, even presenting it at work. The talk
went over great at the conference, and I met some of the other presenters who,
although I didn't know it at the time, would become some of my best friends. 
They told me about all the other regional Python conferences, so I started submitting
my talk to those. I submitted to as many conferences as I could find because,
while my job wouldn't pay for me to go to these conferences, they would give
me time off to do so. At this point, I was desperate to get away from my job,
so I jumped at the opportunity. Over the course of a year, I
traveled to 6 different conferences across three states and two countries to 
give my talk. I started to feel myself returning to my old self. I found that I really
love communities, especially the Python community.

Throughout this time of traveling to conferences, I had a shift at work. I pretty
much washed my hands of my team and started doing work for a new initiative to 
add Data Science containers to our system. I started working with another team 
to deliver this and basically left my original team. The more and more I started
to feel better, the madder I got at my original team. Eventually I essentially
told them to get fucked and joined another team entirely. However, the damage
at that point was done. I was fed up with leadership at the company and the toxic
work culture that started at the C-Suite and trickled down to me. I decided to
leave the company and pursue options elsewhere.

That was the best decision of my life.

## Life After Burnout

The title of this heading is misleading. It makes the assumption that burnout
is something that can entirely go away. I don't think it is. Burnout is ever-present
in our life. What changes is our tolerance to burnout and how far on the burnout
scale we are. Leaving Vrbo didn't immediately solve my burnout. As I've said above, things don't
magically get better the second you start a new job. However, I would like to 
amend that statement and say that if the job is great and the people you work
with are amazing, it can get better a whole lot faster.

I started at DigitalOcean in October 2019, two days after I left Vrbo. I wanted 
to take time off between jobs to relax and try to unwind. It just happened to 
be DigitalOcean was having its global all-hands three weeks after I started. If 
I started any later, I wouldn't be eligible to go. Now DigitalOcean was a remote
company long before the pandemic of 2020 - 202(?) occurred. That meant this would
be my only chance to see my coworkers in person for at least another 
year[^22]. So I decided to just take time off at a later date. Now my job at
DigitalOcean is different from my previous jobs because I didn't accept an
engineering job. After all of my experience with conferences, I decided to give
being a Developer Advocate a try. I had met a few in my travels, and the job
was intriguing to me. So I started my job and met some of my team in person, and
it was amazing. I have never felt so welcomed so quickly. A few weeks later,
I would travel to Disney World[^23] for our company all-hands and immediately
knew that this was a company that I would be at for a long time.

Don't be fooled. A few good weeks is not enough to quell burnout. But it's a start.
It took me a while to undo the defensive mechanisms I had put in place to protect
myself from my last job, like zoning out for an entire day. Even after over
two years on the job, I still feel the pangs of burnout hit me every now and then.


## Will You Just Get to the Point Already?

I know, I know. That was long. I was not anticipating this being this long
when I set out to write it. But I felt that the story needed to be told. So
I'm going to preemptively answer questions I assume this blog will generate
below. When you're reading this, feel free to tweet at me 
[@masonegger](https://twitter.com/masonegger) with your questions, and I'll update
this list.

### So What is Your Opinion on Working Nights and Weekends?

So, I'm going to do something that most people on Twitter haven't done. I'm going
to be honest with you. I'm not going to tell you to not work nights and weekends
because it's bad for you when it's exactly what I did. I can't stand when people
give advice saying "Don't do this" when they actively do it. The truth is, practice
makes perfect. This is true in every aspect of life. To get better at something,
you have actually do it. 

So here's my advice[^24]. 

```
Determine what you want out of your career and how much you want to put into it.
Then, take the necessary actions to achieve your goals. However, you must accept
that everything comes with a tradeoff.
```

I had a trombone professor in college who was filled with amazing sayings.
My favorite saying of his was

```
Look Egger, you have this bowl of chops. And once you're out of chops, you're done.
```

For those who don't speak Jazz Cat, chops are the endurance of your facial muscles
when you play an instrument. There comes a point in time during the day or at
the gig where your face just quits. You're exhausted, you can't form an embouchure,
you're done. Your body is saying, "Nope. We're not doing this until you give me
rest". It is the same exact thing with burnout. Every person has an amount of
stress and bullshit they can tolerate. And then your mind stops and revolts. 
The thing about being a musician is that they know their limits. They know when
they are approaching full exhaustion. If they ignore this and just burn through 
it, they'll need to take some days off before they can perform again. 
If only humans could approach their mental health the same way, they could avoid
burnout. You have to know your limits. And usually, by the time you start feeling
it, you're already screwed. 

The trick with burnout is you can't say, "Oh, I'm starting to feel burnt out; I
should take a vacation." It's too late by then. You're already burnt out. You have
to take breaks before you reach this point. If you don't, you'll need even more
time to correct the burnout. It's very similar to saying, "Oh, I feel sick, I'll
take some Emergen-C." It's too late! You're already sick!

Take the time you need because recovery from burnout is _way_ longer than that
Friday off you were going to take to have a three-day weekend.

### You Didn't Answer the Above Question. Should I Work Nights and Weekends?

It's your choice. Do I do it? I'm not going to lie; sometimes I do. Sometimes
the situation requires me to work late or on the weekend. That's life. The cold 
hard truth is Capitalism thrives on the exploitation of workers. However, sometimes
these workers are rewarded for being exploited. In the tech industry, knowledge
and experience are rewarded with promotions, raises, and better positions. I 
can't lie to you and say that working yourself ragged might not benefit you financially.
But you have to realize that all the money in the world doesn't buy back time
or health.

So I offer you an alternative. If you're going to work outside of work, don't 
work on "work" things. Work on projects you care about. Work on a side business 
idea, contribute to an Open Source project, start a podcast. I understand 
having to fill the time. That's what got me into this in the first place. I
had graduated college and went from being constantly busy to suddenly having 
a large block of free time after 5:00pm with no idea how to fill it. So I filled
it with work.

If you are going to go down this path, you _must_ be aware of your mental status.
You need to define your limits and when to pull back. Burnout can not only burn
every gain that you've made, but it can cause you to lose ground that you 
wouldn't have lost otherwise.

### Will Not Working Nights and Weekends Have a Negative Affect On My Career?

As long as you aren't missing deadlines then not working extra most likely won't
have a negative effect on your career. You just wont get the added benefits of
those who do put in extra hours. 

You have to realize that working after hours isn't just about providing
free labor to your company. It's about getting practice. And with all things in
life, practice makes you more proficient. Whether it's Open Source or free labor,
the practice will benefit you. 

However, it should also be noted that programming is not the singular skill that
determines promotions and salary. Other skills like communication, inter-personal
skills, leadership also have a huge factor in it. You won't be able to just sit
down and code yourself to Principal Engineer. You're going to need some other 
skills.

Also, it really depends on who you work for. Some companies expect after-hours
work. They don't explicitly say this, though. They just set impossible goals and
threaten you if you don't make them. These tend to be your larger companies, 
whose acronym may be what we call a vampire's teeth. If you don't work at one of 
these companies, then probably not.

At the end of the day, you have to determine what you want out of life. Do you
want to be the best coder in the world? Or do you just want a stable job with
a nice salary and good benefits? You'd be surprised how many people opt for the 
latter. 

### Are You Saying If I Go to Conferences That Will Cure My Burnout?

Oh fuck no. In all truth, that shouldn't have worked. I am somehow fucked up
enough that I was able to cure my professional burnout with something within 
my profession. 

You're welcome to try this approach. I hope it works for you. If so, we'll probably
be great friends.

## Conclusion

Burnout is an ever-present threat. It is vital that you are diligent in taking
care of your mental and physical health. It is way easier to be proactive  
against burnout than reactive. I lost about two years of my life in a dull haze
due to burnout. Hopefully, you'll be able to learn from my experience and guard
yourself against burnout. I should also say that I feel like I am one of the 
lucky ones. I feel I have made a substantial recovery. Some people never recover.
Ask educators. They'll tell you all about it.

[^1]: This would have been 2008. My family had gotten dial-up around 2005-2006, but I was not given unfettered access to it. It was also so slow I rarely used it.

[^2]: For those of you unaware of the Top 10 program in Texas, any student who was in the Top 10 students of their class was automatically accepted to any public University in the state of Texas. I didn't really know where I wanted to go. In hindsight, where I wound up was not where I anticipated. However, the idea of automatic acceptance and the potential for more scholarships pretty much limited my course selections to only advanced courses that would have a weighted effect on my GPA.

[^3]: Yet

[^4]: UIL is the governing board for extra-curricular student activities in Texas. It manages everything, from sports to band to competitive academics.

[^5]: This may sound made up, but it is 100% the truth. 

[^6]: This is a _vast_ reduction of how this actually happened. In reality, it took me 2 years to fully make the switch, and I still wound up with a Music degree and a Computer Science degree. One day I'll write out that journey, but just know I didn't just wake up one morning and go "Time to be a CS Major!".

[^7]: To this day, this is still one of my all-time favorite jobs. The pay was alright for a broke college student (I was making $10 an hour in 2012), and the environment was intoxicating. Everyone was there to learn and share ideas. These years will definitely go down as some of the happiest in my life.

[^8]: This was the max I was allowed to actually clock because of university rules. I know I worked 40 hour work weeks 95% of the time and got paid for 25 hour work weeks. I know some people will look at this in horror, but this was my choice. It wasn't that I had deadlines or was being forced; I was _learning_ and had access to a university's nearly infinite computing resources. In my mind, if I didn't take advantage of this situation, I would be a fool.

[^9]: The math there is a tiny bit over three years

[^10]: I competed in a few Capture the Flags and National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition hosted by Raytheon.

[^11]: This was an _experience_ and I will definitely write a post about what that was like in the future.

[^12]: Looking back, this is probably one of the stupidest things I've ever done.

[^13]: I have no idea why I decided to go with "Chipper" here and say this in a British accent as I wrote it. Just go with it. 

[^14]: Just typing that makes me feel old.

[^15]: Ours sure as shit couldn't. Well, it could. But it shouldn't. That's a rant for another day.

[^16]: That being said, I don't regret my choice. I very much believe in pushing forward and making things work. Although my experience at Vrbo was awful, as you're about to read, I was still able to take what I learned and land my next job. 

[^17]: Which you have to deal with at _every_ company. That never goes away.

[^18]: There is _soooo_ much more to this story. I'm abridging it for the sake of this article, but I guarantee you I could cause any HR person to faint if I told the whole story about this job. 

[^19]: I would later use all of this knowledge in my role as a Developer Advocate at DigitalOcean.

[^20]: Mostly music education conferences.

[^21]: The talk is titled ["Docs Like Code: Continuous Integration for Documentation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftnVllssoI8).

[^22]: And then 2020 happened and completely fucked that up. I haven't seen a vast majority of my coworkers since this time.

[^23]: You read that right. Disney World.

[^24]: I'm putting this in a special style to emphasize it.
